**SQL injection ( also know as SQL fishing ) is a kind of technique that often used to attack data driven apps.** <br>
This is done by including portions of SQL a in an entry field in an attempt to get the web to pass a newly formed rouge SQL command to database ( e.g. dump the database contents to the attackers ). <br>
SQL injection is code injection technique that exploits a security vulnerability in an application's software. <br>
The vulnerability happens when user input is either incorrectly filtered for string literal escape characters embedded in SQL statements or user input is not strongly typed and unexpectedly executed. <br>
SQL injection is mostly know as an attack vector for websites but can used to attack any type of SQL database.
